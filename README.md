Locus is a free, open source app for Android and iOS that allows you to share your location live. It
encrypts your location end-to-end, meaning that no one, not even we, can read it. It stores the
location decentralized on multiple servers of your choice using Nostr, meaning that you are not
locked to a service. No authentication required.

Locus is currently not in active development. I am unable to work on it as much as I would like.
I will still fix security issues and maintain it, but there will not be any new features in the
foreseeable future. I am open for any Pull Requests.

# Download

**iOS currently does not have a release. You will need to build and install the app yourself.**

Locus comes in two variants for Android:

* GMS: This variant uses Google Play Services to get your location. **If you have Google Play Services
  installed**, you **must use** this variant. F-Droid uses this version
* FLOSS: This variant is completely libre and does not use any proprietary software. If you have **NO
  Google Play Services installed**, you **must use** this variant.

When downloading from GitHub, you can choose from both options.

# Supporting Locus

You can support Locus in various ways:

## Contribute to the project

Add a new feature or fix bugs.

## Add translations

Translate Locus into your language so that other people can use it more easily.

## Donate

It might sound crazy, but if you would just donate 1$, it would totally mean to world to me, since
it's a really small amount and if everyone did that, I can totally focus on Alibi and my other open
source projects. :)

You can donate via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Myzel394) or via [crypto currencies](https://github.com/Myzel394/contact-me?tab=readme-ov-file#donations).
